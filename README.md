# Mango

Mango is an Open Source Framework. Or at least it should be in the future.
A playground for people like me.

Just to be clear: This is not the first attempt!
I plan to implement various features, with main focus on computer graphics.
A few of them are described below, but there will be added a lot more in the future.
There should also always be a documentation and tests to ensure cleaner and more functional code.

If you have suggestions for improvement or find a bug just let me know.
Keep in mind that I do this in my spare time, besides studying and working.
Also have a look at the [Website](https://paul-hi.github.io/Mango/)!

## Features

* Building and running on Linux and Windows.
* Basic support of GLTF models (No animations yet, some features missing, no draco encoding)
* HDR support and image based lighting
* Directional light with Cascaded Shadow Mapping
* Basic GUI with DearImGui with widgets
* Many physically based rendering features
* Deferred rendering with OpenGL backend
* Entity Component System
* Basic framework architecture
* Editor featuring .gltf and .hdr file loading and a simple camera controller
* Profiling with [Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy)

## Requirements

* Python Version 3.x
* minimum CMake Version 3.10
* some c++14 compatible compiler
* optional: Doxygen and Graphviz for generating the documentation (Make sure everything is in the PATH and functional)

## Build

For an easy build you (hopefully) just need to run the ```fetch_dependencies.py``` script.
This will init and update the submodules and populate the dependencies folder with the dependencies mentioned down below.

There are a few extra options in the cmake configuration:
* MANGO_BUILD_DOC (Default ON): This builds the documentation for mango.
* MANGO_BUILD_TESTS (Default OFF): This enables the "Testing Mode" in mango and builds the tests. This should ONLY be enabled, if you plan to run the tests. It enables and disables functionalities in mango.
* MANGO_ENABLE_HARD_WARNINGS (Default OFF): This enables some warning compiler flags. Attention: This could cause Mango to stop building.
* MANGO_PROFILE (Default OFF): This enables profiling mode that can be used to profile Mango with Tracy. You will need to install the Tracy-0.7.0 Visual Profiler from [here](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy/releases/tag/v0.7).

After that you can run```cmake``` and build Mango like that:

```console
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Insert Generator Here" ..
```

After that it should be possible to build with some make derivate or under Windows with a Visual Studio solution.

If you still have a problem just reach out to me on GitHub and I'll try to fix it.

## Usage

Just head into ```\build``` and run ```make install``` to install Mango.
There is a default install path ```install\mango\bin``` where the editor executable can be found. But you can also specify another one.
As an alternative you could just go to ```\build\debug\bin``` or ```\build\release\bin``` and run the editor executable, but keep in mind that you'll have to copy the ```\res``` folder there to get it to work properly. Also there seem to be some slowdowns when the file dialog is opened with attached debugger.

## Roadmap (unordered and incomplete)

* Implementing the compilation and saving of scenes (own format and gltf export)
* More lights
* Support for GLTF animations
* Support for translucent materials
* Rendering improvements (performance and appearance)
* Scene management improvements
* More performance measurement tools
* Some better examples for the use of Mango
* Many features like shadows, global light effects (GI, AO, reflections), live editing, hot swapable resources, and more

## Dependencies

* GLAD
* GLFW3
* Eigen
* spdlog
* tiny_gltf
* stb_image
* dear imgui
* tiny file dialogs
* optional

* tracy (Profiling)
* googletest (Testing)
* Doxygen (Documentation)
