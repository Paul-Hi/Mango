                Mango is an Open Source Framework. Or at least it should be in the future.
                A playground for people like me.<br /><br />
                Just to be clear: This is not the first attempt!
                I plan to implement various features, with main focus on computer graphics.
                A few of them are described below, but there will be added a lot more in the future.
                There should also always be a documentation and tests to ensure cleaner and more
                functional
                code.<br /><br />
                If you have suggestions for improvement or find a bug just let me know on <a class="mango-link" href="https://github.com/Paul-Hi/Mango">GitHub</a>.
                Keep in mind that I do this in my spare time, besides studying and working.<br /><br />
                For more info have a look at the first blog post
