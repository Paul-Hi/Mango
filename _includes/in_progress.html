    After implementing some core functionalities, I now spend most of my time cleaning up. Tests have to be
    written. Improvements have to be made.<br><br>

    Regarding new features:
    <br>
    I recently added some basic editor UI. I will add some images soon.
    <br>
    I also want more lights, not just the image-based environment, but before adding this there is a lot of work to do.
    The ECS and the scenes as a whole need to be improved.
